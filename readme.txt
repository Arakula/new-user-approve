New User Approve is a Wordpress plugin that allows a blog administrator to 
approve a user before they are able to access and login to the blog.

== Description ==

In a normal Wordpress blog, once a new user registers, the user is created in 
the database. Then an email is sent to the new user with their login 
credentials. Very simple. As it should be.

The New User Approve plugin changes up the registration process. When a user 
registers for the blog, the user gets created and then an email gets sent to 
the administrators of the site. An administrator then is expected to either 
approve or deny the registration request. An email is then sent to the user 
indicating whether they were approved or denied. If the user was approved, 
the email will include the login credentials. Until a user is approved, the 
user will not be able to login to the site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload new-user-approve to the wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. No configuration necessary.
